# üí´ About Me:
‚Äôm a 17-year-old with a relentless curiosity for cybersecurity, programming, and reverse engineering. My journey into tech started with a simple question: ‚ÄúHow does this actually work?‚Äù That question quickly evolved into countless hours of breaking things apart‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs software, malware samples, or code‚Äîjust to understand the inner logic and hidden mechanisms that make it all function.<br><br>‚ö° My Focus Areas<br><br>I‚Äôm especially interested in:<br><br>Malware Analysis ‚Äì Studying how malicious code behaves, experimenting in controlled environments, and understanding the techniques attackers use to evade detection.<br><br>Reverse Engineering (RE) ‚Äì Taking apart binaries, analyzing low-level instructions, and uncovering the logic that lies beneath compiled programs.<br><br>Programming ‚Äì Writing my own tools, scripts, and experiments to better understand security concepts, automate tasks, or replicate attack/defense techniques.<br><br>Cybersecurity Fundamentals ‚Äì Exploring everything from operating system internals to network security, because I believe the strongest foundation comes from understanding technology at its core.<br><br>üîç My Mindset<br><br>I see cybersecurity as a never-ending puzzle. Every exploit, every piece of malware, every vulnerability tells a story‚Äîand I love piecing together those stories. For me, learning is not limited to textbooks or tutorials; it‚Äôs hands-on, messy, and often trial-and-error. I‚Äôll spend hours chasing down a bug or analyzing assembly code not just because I want the answer, but because I love the process of discovery.<br><br>I‚Äôm not satisfied with surface-level knowledge. I want to understand why something works, how it was built, and what happens when it breaks. That mindset is what drives me deeper into the world of cybersec and keeps me motivated to keep pushing boundaries.<br><br>##üîß What I Do in My Free Time<br><br>When I‚Äôm not studying or working on projects, I‚Äôm usually:<br><br>Breaking down malware samples in a lab environment.<br><br>Writing code (in languages like Python, C/C++, and others) to build small tools or explore concepts.<br><br>Practicing reverse engineering challenges, CTFs, or experimenting with disassemblers/debuggers.<br><br>Reading about new vulnerabilities, exploits, and techniques in the security world.<br><br>Diving into technical blogs, research papers, and security write-ups to stay up to date with trends.<br><br>üöÄ My Future Goals<br><br>I know that I‚Äôm still early in my journey, but I‚Äôm committed to turning this passion into a long-term career. My ultimate goals are to:<br><br>Develop advanced skills in malware research and reverse engineering.<br><br>Contribute to the cybersecurity community by sharing knowledge, tools, and research.<br><br>Work on projects that make a real difference in protecting systems and people from cyber threats.<br><br>Never stop learning, because in tech‚Äîand especially in cybersecurity‚Äîthere‚Äôs always something new to explore.<br><br>üåê What Drives Me<br><br>At the end of the day, tech isn‚Äôt just a hobby for me‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifestyle. I enjoy the challenge of cybersecurity because it‚Äôs one of the few fields where curiosity is not just encouraged, it‚Äôs required. The digital world is constantly evolving, and with it, the threats evolve too. To me, that‚Äôs exciting. It means there‚Äôs always another problem to solve, another system to understand, and another mystery to uncover.
